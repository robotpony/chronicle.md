#	TODO

## Mega-focus

* Make Chronicle self-hosting (i.e., README.md hosted in default pull)
	* Suggests moving Presto as submodule module (does this work with Opsworks/Chef?)
* PHP 5.4 minimum version (namespaces, etc.)
* Parsedown
* CLI
* simple install script (npm, php, bash)
	
## Version 1

These features are planned for the version 1 release.

**Command line interface**. Add a few commands to make Chronicle easier to work with:

*Installer.* The installer is separate (run once) script, as its symlinks are not yet set up. It creates the base symlinks, folders, site settings file, and routing (htaccess). It is careful not to tromp existing files.

	$ ./lib/chronicle.md/install

After installation, a `chronicle` script is available in the site root. This is used for both showing the site, and for the command line tools.

*Add a new draft.* This creates a Markdown file with the basic metadata, and the provided title. It will create the drafts folder if it does not exist, and it finishes by opening the draft using the system's preferred Markdown editor. It will also add the file to `git` if it's being used for this blog.

	$ chronicle "Some post title" 

*Publish a draft.* This publishes a draft to the configured blog folder or the optional folder specified. It updates the post date.

	$ chronicle publish some-file-name.md <blog>

*Other command line ideas* include:

* Scan posts for syntax errors (missing meta, etc.)
* Update configuration (with missing values)


### Bugs

See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/robotpony/chronicle.md/issues) for a list of current bugs.

### Needed cleanup

1. Split out template API
2. Add post processing plugin mechanism, and split text munging to a plugin.
3. Clean up folder abstractions


## Features I'd love to add soon

1. Micro-formats for: including source code, graphs
2. Caching of the "listings" data if it's needed (measure this).
3. Auto write of settings if missing.
4. Command line access/setup tool. `chronic install`, for example. This pattern may fit in Presto? (I need it elsewhere)



## Version 2
